When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  If I would have a team working together on the same project. Also If some organisation 
  wants me to show some of my code or project to them.
 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because maybe I want to pull only logically considerable and meaningfull versions
	of the project or maybe I want to pull only after I finish some piece of work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks is purely GitHub feature and I will use it if I want to make some changes to the existing
	project of other people. Branches is the chains of commits in history. Clones may be both in my
	local machine and when I clone something from the GitHub.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	You can work on your own feateres and there will be less probability of merging conflicts
	if you try to have a copy of the last known state of the remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Via email, skype, social networks. It is easier to use version control system like Git.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits 
does each approach have?

	I want to make changes in a separate branch when I want to experiment on a new feature or when I want to
	modify original project without impacting it's main version.
