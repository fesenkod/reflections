When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  If I would have a team working together on the same project. Also If some organisation 
  wants me to show some of my code or project to them.
 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because maybe I want to pull only logically considerable and meaningfull versions
	of the project or maybe I want to pull only after I finish some piece of work.
